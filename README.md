TA (Text Adventure)
===================

Text Adventure Demo

This is a simple text adventure game using Python's builtin `cmd` and `textwrap` modules to interract with the user on the command line. It uses the builtin `json` module to read a json file where you can define the "Finite State Machine" that is the world you explore within the game. A 9-yr-old girl namd "Ella" dreamt up, composed, and debugged the json file at "the-magic-mission.json" (with help from her cousins). This is the default world you load with the command `python story.py`.

Based almost entirely on a fork of "Text Adventure Demo" by [Al Sweigart](mailto:al@inventwithpython.com) at https://github.com/asweigart/textadventuredemo
His tutorial for building this module is at http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2014/12/04/making-a-text-adventure-game-with-the-cmd-and-textwrap-modules

I'll be amazed if you can figure out how to Download the ZIP file containing the text adventure game, but I thought I'd just treat you like an engineer and see what happens. Github.com is where develpers share software with one another.

Here's the "repository" where I put the Text Adventure game.

If you have any trouble at all just text or e-mail and I'll help you. And I can help you run it too. One way is to unzip the file into a folder and then drag it into the PythonLauncher (I'll have to help you with all this).
To change the game or create your own, you will need a good text editor like PyCharm. It's free and you can install it from here:
